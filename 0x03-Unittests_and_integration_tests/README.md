Unittests and Integration Tests

Unit Tests vs. Integration Tests:
Unit Tests:
Purpose:
Unit tests are written to test individual units or components of a software application in isolation.
They verify that each unit of code (function, method, or class) behaves as expected.
Scope:
Unit tests typically focus on a small piece of code, testing it independently of other components.
Dependencies:
Unit tests often use mocking to isolate the unit being tested from its dependencies.
Execution:
Unit tests are usually fast to execute and can be run frequently during development to catch regressions early.
Integration Tests:
Purpose:
Integration tests check that different parts of an application work together correctly.
They verify the interactions between components and ensure that the integrated system functions as intended.
Scope:
Integration tests cover scenarios where multiple components interact with each other.
Dependencies:
Integration tests typically involve real resources or external dependencies like databases, APIs, or other services.
Execution:
Integration tests may be slower to execute compared to unit tests due to their broader scope and dependencies.
